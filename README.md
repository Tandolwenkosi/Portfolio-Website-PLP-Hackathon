This repository contains the source code for a responsive and visually cohesive personal portfolio website built with HTML5 and CSS3. It showcases semantic markup, clean design principles, and interactive styling techniques. The CSS implementation includes modern styling techniques such as flexbox and grid layouts, hover effects, keyframe animations, and media queries for mobile responsiveness. Special attention has been given to visual consistency across sections, branding alignment through color theory, and interactive design elements that elevate user experience. This project serves as both a showcase of front-end development skills and a foundation for future enhancements, such as JavaScript interactivity or component-based frameworks. Key features include:
- Semantic HTML structure (<section>, <navigation bar>, <header>, etc.)
- Responsive design with mobile-first principles
- CSS animations and hover effects for interactivity
- Consistent branding using color theory and typography
- Modular layout for easy scalability and updates
